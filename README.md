Goals
	1.	Design and build test setups, hardware integrations, and software solutions.
	2.	Develop equipment control software using C/C++/C# and integrate LabVIEW/scripting.
	3.	Learn and maintain the codebase: testing, debugging, continuous improvements.
	4.	Create and run unit tests in a simulation environment.
	5.	Gather and document user requirements (Engineering, Process, Customer teams).
	6.	Provide technical support, troubleshoot integration issues.
	7.	Write/update operator guides, technical manuals, and training docs.
	8.	Perform daily hands-on testing (2–4 hrs) in a cleanroom environment.
	9.	Support domestic deployment/troubleshooting.

Skills to Apply
	•	C/C++/C# development
	•	LabVIEW + scripting (Python, MATLAB, etc.)
	•	Mechatronics & automation
	•	Computer vision (optional module)
	•	Software documentation & coding standards

Instructions for the AI Agent
	1.	Project Planning
	•	Break down the project into phases (requirements → design → implementation → testing → deployment).
	•	Define deliverables, milestones, and success metrics.
	2.	Execution
	•	For each phase, generate detailed steps.
	•	Write example code snippets (C/C++/C#, LabVIEW pseudocode, scripts).
	•	Suggest hardware/software integration workflows.
	3.	Validation
	•	After each step, check requirements:
	•	Does this align with user requirements?
	•	Is software following coding standards?
	•	Are hardware/software integrations testable?
	•	Are documentation and operator guides updated?
	4.	Iteration
	•	If requirements are unmet, propose fixes and improvements.
	•	Repeat validation until all goals are satisfied.
	5.	Output Format
Always respond in sections:
	•	Phase Overview
	•	Step-by-Step Actions
	•	Validation Checklist
	•	Next Actions
